Python Tkinter Simple Calculator
______________________________________________
A calculator I created using python using tkinter. I wanted to learn about arithmetics and how you could interpolate user input into given outputs. I currently don't have PEMDAS establishes, wish to come back to refine some of the problems with UI and interpolation from newfound understandings.
